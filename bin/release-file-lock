release-file-lock - Release a lock on a file

Usage:
    release-file-lock <filepath> <agent-id>

Arguments:
    filepath    Path to the file to unlock (relative to project root)
    agent-id    Your agent identifier (e.g., "agent-0")

Description:

    IMPORTANT: Always release locks when you're done editing to allow
    other agents to work on the file.

Examples:
    # Release a lock
    release-file-lock src/auth.py agent-2

    # Release after completing work
    release-file-lock src/models.py agent-3

Exit Codes:
    0   Lock released successfully
    1   You don't hold the lock on this file
    2   Invalid arguments or other error
